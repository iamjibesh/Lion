        <p>My name is NARNIA, even though people generally call me Lion, it is completely wrong and insulting.
          I have a name you <strong>idiots</strong>. Okay, name aside,I am in my adulthood right now having 5 Lioness. Their names are... Leave it,
          I know you are gonna call them lion(not even lioness) anyways! I have so many cubs, I don't like them at all! I live in a
          beautifull cave. I have a nice neighbourhood and every other animal living in the Jungle loves me(LOL!).
          My eating habits are very simple. I eat very little, somewhere around 10-15 KGs a day. My dear lioness hunts for me (so sweet of them ‚ù§).
          All in all, I'm living a very Healthy and Happy life here at Jungle.

  <p>Don't believe in those ratings provided by the Blood Sucking Jungle Commitee! I'm good at everything man. I take good care of my cubs,
    I just don't like them! They provided 4 star in hunting, can you believe that? I deserve 10/5! And talking about chicks,
    They die for me. Just don't believe this rubbish ratings. I attached it here because it's a Jungle rule! Do check out my <a href="photo_library.html"><strong>Photo Library</strong></a> for proof! </p>
